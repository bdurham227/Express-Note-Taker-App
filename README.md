## Description
The Express Note Taker Application bridges application once stuck in the command prompt to the browser by using Express.Js. Express allows us to quickly set up a server via localhost. From there we can easily serve up Html files powered by Javascript to present the user with a dynamic application. This application was fun to work and gave me an opportunity to try out using async/await on the htmlroutes.js file. Areas I would like to improve on would be to refactor the code further to be 100% asynchronous and to add update requests to the user to complete the app as a fully functional CRUD application.
